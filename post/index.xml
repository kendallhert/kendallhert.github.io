Before even diving into reticulate, it is obvious that R-studio and Python have their differences. It was a difficult transition, but I have come to really enjoy Python.

      <description>All about Darrell Hello world! Here is my dacshund, Darrell, in a cow costume.Darrell is six years old and his favorite things to do include playing fetch, going through the Starbucks drive-thru for puppuccinos, and sleeping inside of the fuzziest blankets he can find.
I got Darrell when he was just nine months old, he was dumped in a parking lot and of course I had to take him home with me.</description>
