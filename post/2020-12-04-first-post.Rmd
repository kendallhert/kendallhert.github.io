#All about Darrell
Hello world! Here is my dacshund, Darrell, in a cow costume.![](/post/2020-12-04-first-post_files/39A64D1A-1A54-4B0F-BC89-2378ACE01FA7.JPG){width=50% height=50%}

Darrell is six years old and his favorite things to do include playing fetch, going through the Starbucks drive-thru for puppuccinos, and sleeping inside of the fuzziest blankets he can find. 

I got Darrell when he was just nine months old, he was dumped in a parking lot and of course I had to take him home with me. He came to live with me in Austin when I moved into my own apartment, and he is now officially a ~big city boi~
